# School_District_Analysis# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze school and student data and report school performance based on key metrics such as School Budget, School Type, Students Passing Rates for Math and Reading subjects. It is to be analyzed how removing Thomas High School 9th grade scores affects these overall key metric results by comparing it with original data results.

## Resources
- Data source: schools_complete.csv, students_complete.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Jupyter notebook 6.4.8

## Results
Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

How is the district summary affected?

After removing 9th Grade scores from Thomas High Schools, the changes to the final district results are minimal, almost insignificant to what the original results obtained. If both passing percentages are rounded, the results would be the exact same.


How is the school summary affected?

After removing 9th Grade scores from Thomas High Schools, there are significant changes to the percenatge passing scores for Thomas High School. While original score percentages were both above 90% for both math and reading, scores are now lower 70%. This clearly indicates that the original 9th grade data had very high results compared to other grades from the school which did not average above 70%

How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
- Math and reading scores by grade
- Scores by school spending
- Scores by school size
- Scores by school type
